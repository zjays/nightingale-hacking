Congratulations, you've downloaded a nightly build!

This means you're running what we're running: cutting edge, bleeding new bits
that have no guarantee *whatsoever*.  Could it trash your library?  Possibly.  
Could it crash in wonderful newfound ways?  Definitely.  Could it make your 
computer do the macarena?  Not likely, but if it does - we'd love to see a bug
filed.

These nightly builds are provided for:

1) Developers wanting to developer new add-ons or website integrations
   using newly delivered APIs that aren't fully baked into a regular release
   yet.

2) Awesome users who want to test our latest stuff to find and fix bugs 
   and who don't mind a little pain.

If you're running an old nightly, you can always grab the latest nightly at:

https://sourceforge.net/projects/ngale/files/trunk-Nightlies/

If you think you've found a bug, please ensure you can reproduce with a recent
nightly and file your bug at

https://github.com/nightingale-media-player/nightingale-hacking/issues

Thanks for helping us test!
