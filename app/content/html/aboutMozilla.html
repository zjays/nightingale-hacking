                And after the Mammon forced the birds to sing <em>another tune</em>, one
                escaped and found herself a new nest. She laid eggs that hatched
                <em>much</em> later, when the world was enveloped in silence. The
                hatchlings came forth and <em>broke</em> the silence with a new tune.
