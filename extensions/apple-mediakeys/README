== Apple Media Key Support for Songbird (aka 'whitedragon')
== Author: Nick Kreeger <nick.kreeger@gmail.com>

== About

This extension provides the ability to control Songbird via the apple media keys that ship with
newer Apple keyboards.

== Building

Setup a copy of the Songbird source code using the steps here:
http://wiki.songbirdnest.com/Developer/Articles/Getting_Started/Core_Player_Development/Checkout_the_Code#Get_the_Client_Trunk

1.) Clone this project in the "/path/to/svncheckout/Songbird1.8/extensions/" directory.
(NOTE: The 'Songbird1.8' directory is the branch name of the latest release)

3.) Edit the 'DEFAULT_EXTENSIONS' target in the Makefile at
    "/path/to/svncheckout/Songbird1.8/extensions/Makefile.in" to include the 'whitedragon' folder:
    
      DEFAULT_EXTENSIONS = AlbumArt \
                           concerts \
                           xpcom_helloworld \
    +                      whitedragon \
                           $(NULL)
                         
4.) Build Songbird following the instructions at:
http://wiki.songbirdnest.com/Developer/Articles/Getting_Started/Core_Player_Development/Building_Songbird#MacOSX

5.) Locate the XPI file installed in the "xpi-stage" directory, which is usually around:
    "/path/to/svncheckout/Songbird1.8/compiled/xpi-state/whitedragon/whitedragon-*.xpi"

== NOTES

* The "extension-config.mk" file has been tweaked to hard-code the compatability of Songbird to 1.8
  since the publicsvn repo was never updated past Songbird1.8b3. If you're working with trunk,
  be sure to update the EXTENSION_MIN_VER/EXTENSION_MAX_VER targets to point at the Songbird
  version you're building against.

* Apple always launches iTunes via the RCD daemon process that ships with the OS. To disable this
  by default, either leave Quicktime running or install this:
