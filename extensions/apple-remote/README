This README was adopted from the the Apple Media Key Support extension README, source here:

== About

This extension provides the ability to control Nightingale via the apple media remote that ships with iMacs and MacBooks.

== Building

Setup a copy of the Nightingale source code using the steps here:
http://wiki.getnightingale.com/doku.php?id=build:mac

1.) Clone this project in the "/nightingale-hacking/extensions/" directory.

2.) Edit the 'DEFAULT_EXTENSIONS' target in the Makefile at
    "/nightingale-hacking/extensions/Makefile.in" to include the 'mac-remote-control' folder:
    
      DEFAULT_EXTENSIONS = AlbumArt \
                           concerts \
                           xpcom_helloworld \
    +                      mac-remote-control \
                           $(NULL)
                         
4.) Build Nightingale following the instructions at:
http://wiki.getnightingale.com/doku.php?id=build:mac

5.) Locate the XPI file installed in the "xpi-stage" directory, which is usually around:
    "/nightingale-hacking/compiled/xpi-stage/mac-remote-control/mac-remote-control-*.xpi"

== NOTES

* The "extension-config.mk" file has been tweaked to hard-code the compatability of Nightingale from version 1.4.* to 2.0.*
  since the publicsvn repo was never updated past Songbird1.8b3. If you're working with a newer version,
  be sure to update the EXTENSION_MIN_VER/EXTENSION_MAX_VER targets to point at the Nightingale
  version you're building against.

* Apple always launches iTunes via the RCD daemon process that ships with the OS. To disable this
  by default, either leave Quicktime running or install this:
